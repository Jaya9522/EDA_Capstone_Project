The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market.
Each app (row) has values for catergory, rating, size, and more. Another dataset contains customer reviews of the android apps.
Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for app engagement and success.
